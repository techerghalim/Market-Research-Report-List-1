<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Valve Prostheses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Type</li><li>Biological Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The valve prostheses market is primarily divided into two types: mechanical and biological. Mechanical valve prostheses are constructed from durable materials like metal and plastic, offering long-lasting performance but often requiring lifelong anticoagulation therapy. In contrast, biological valve prostheses are derived from animal tissues or human donors and provide a more natural function, reducing the need for medications, though they have a shorter lifespan. Each type caters to different patient needs, preferences, and medical conditions in cardiac surgery.</p></p>
