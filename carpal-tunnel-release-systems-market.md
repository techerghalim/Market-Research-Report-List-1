<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carpal Tunnel Release Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open CTR Systems</li><li>Endoscopic CTR Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Carpal Tunnel Release (CTR) Systems market is primarily categorized into two types: Open CTR Systems and Endoscopic CTR Systems. Open CTR Systems involve a traditional surgical approach where a larger incision is made to access the carpal tunnel, allowing for direct visualization and release of the transverse carpal ligament. In contrast, Endoscopic CTR Systems utilize a minimally invasive technique with smaller incisions and a camera-assisted view, reducing recovery time and improving patient outcomes. Both approaches address carpal tunnel syndrome effectively.</p></p>
