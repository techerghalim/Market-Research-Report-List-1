<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport Catering Suppliers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-house</li><li>Outsourced</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airport catering suppliers market is divided into two primary types: in-house and outsourced. In-house catering involves airlines or airport authorities managing their food services directly, allowing for tighter control over quality and menu offerings. Conversely, outsourced catering relies on specialized external companies to provide food services, often leveraging their expertise and efficiency.
